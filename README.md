# LaTeX Tutor

LaTeX Tutor is an open source project which provides 

- a format for disributing small, targeted lessons for learning LaTeX
- a sample repository (this one) where which lessons may be created, edited, 
  and distributed.
- an [App](https://jxxcarlson.github.io/app/latexTutor/index.html) for "reading" the lessons.

There are two files of note, `latex-simple` and `latex-commented`, each illustrating a possible format in which one can write lessons. We will add a few other formats in the near future.  If you use these files as template, the reader app will be able to display them.

A ready-to-use version of the app is found here in the folder `./app`.  Just copy it to whatever location suits you and point your browser to `./app/index.html`.


The source code is in [this repository](https://github.com/jxxcarlson/latex-game-engine), with the most recent work in the `format` branch. The app is written in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org).
