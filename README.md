# LaTeX Tutor

LaTeX Tutor is an open source project which provides 

- a format for disributing small, targeted lessons for learning LaTeX
- a sample repository (this one) where which lessons may be created, edited, 
  and distributed.
- an [App](https://jxxcarlson.github.io/app/latexTutor/index.html) for "playing" the lessons.

A ready-to-use version of the app is found here in the folder `./app`.  Just copy it to whatever location suits and point your browser to `./app/index.html`.
The source code is in [this repository](https://github.com/jxxcarlson/latex-game-engine).
